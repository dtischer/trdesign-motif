PyRosetta script to generate PDBs from hallucinated 6D transforms

copied from /projects/casp/CASP14/server_pipe/folding/ on 20210328

supports --roll option, which is used with Jue's fold.sh script.

not sure if this script is newer or older than the one in trFolding, but the
two are pretty different so leaving them separate for now.
