Scripts for sequence design

--------------
Jue's pipeline

To generate .pdb files from hallucinations:

    ./fold.sh FOLDER

where FOLDER contains .npz files output by hallucination/design.py. If using
hallucination_trr1.5/design.py, use:

    ./fold.sh -r FOLDER

To do Fastdesign,

    ./make_fd_list.sh FOLDER TEMPLATE.pdb RECEPTOR.pdb INTERFACE_RES.txt > fd.list
    ./submit_fd.sh fd.list

where FOLDER contains .pdb files (from hallucination) to design, TEMPLATE.pdb
is the pdb of the natural binder you are mimicking, RECEPTOR.pdb is the
receptor (in the same coordinates as the template) to design in the context of,
and INTERFACE_RES.txt is a space-delimited list of numbers of residues you want
to place Ca coordinate restraints and force native AA identity on.
