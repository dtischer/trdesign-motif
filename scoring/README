Calculate lddt, cce10, avg_all_frags: 

   ./calc_metrics.sh FOLDER 

Also include contig rmsd:

   ./calc_metrics.sh FOLDER TEMPLATE RECEPTOR 

Also include contig and interface rmsd: 

   ./calc_metrics.sh FOLDER TEMPLATE RECEPTOR INTERFACE_RES_FILE

FOLDER should contain PDBs of hallucinations or fastdesigns. TEMPLATE and
RECEPTOR are PDB files representing the natural binder and natural receptor,
respectively. INTERFACE_RES_FILE should contain space-delimited integers. This
script will calculate metrics on every pdb and leave outputs in FOLDER.

To parse the outputs of the above and combine into a CSV (pandas dataframe):

    ./compile_metrics.sh FOLDER

This will leave a file, combined_metrics.csv, in FOLDER. If the PDBs in FOLDER
are FastDesign outputs, Rosetta filters in the PDB files will also be included
in the csv.
